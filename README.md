- Drag and drop functionality for on-screen rectangles.
- Real-time interaction with graphical user interface.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- cvzone
- numpy
- math

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy
```
